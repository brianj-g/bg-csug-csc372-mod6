# Module 6 CTA
# Option #2: Storing an ArrayList II

Create a Java program that will store 10 student objects in an `ArrayList<Student>`. A student object consists of the following fields:

- `int rollno`
- `String name`
- `String address`

Implement a comparator class to sort student objects by `rollno` (roll number). Implement your own **merge sort** method and place your code in a separate Java source file. **Do not** use a sort method from the Java collections library.

Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments created. GIT repositories should be established and screen captures of repositories submitted with each assignment.
